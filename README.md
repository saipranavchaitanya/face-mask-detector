# Face Mask Detector

A computer vision project that detects whether a person is wearing a face mask using Python, OpenCV, and a deep learning model. The system works in real time with a webcam or video input.

## Overview

This project detects human faces in images or video streams and classifies them as **with mask** or **without mask**. It is designed as a learning and demonstration project for computer vision and deep learning concepts.

## Features

- Real-time face detection using OpenCV  
- Mask / No-mask classification using a trained model  
- Webcam-based live detection  
- Easy to run and modify  

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saipranavchaitanya/face-mask-detector.git
cd face-mask-detector
